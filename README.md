# Object_Detection_AI_Basic
As part of my learning journey I am working towards learning how to use ImageAI package, python and object detection software to detect objects in images all part of a larger project.

I always like to learn new stuff and what better learning experience than AI and machine learning. I learned about ImageAI which uses several packages and a spearate model to detect objects in images fed into it.

I did the work in Virtual ENV so the files will be for that, specifics of the project are below and the "Requirements.txt" file will include all needed packages which can be installed with the following command: 

pip install -r Requirements.txt

Python Version: 3.7.6

The .h5 heiarchy model is all thanks to the following github repo: https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases

There might issues when working on the following project here are some of the additional fixes I had to perform

1. Install Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools and install Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or later
2. Install CUDA due to my computer having an NVIDIA GPU as it solves a .dll error when running
3. Make sure to follow the requirements for ImageAI in the provided link otherwise updating ImageAI with python 3.9 or later has causes issues for me.
